  "course_name": "The Coding Career Handbook - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "The non-coding part of being a successful software engineer is very important, but also happens to be very under-discussed.\n\nThis is a course about getting great coding jobs and doing well at coding jobs. Especially if you're earlier in your career, there's a lot here that you might otherwise take years to learn, and your manager will never tell you.\n\nThis is NOT going to be a conventional career advice course. There is a linear discussion of Career Guides, followed by a nonlinear collection of Principles, Strategies, and Tactics - independent essays of ideas that you may or may not agree with but are worth considering anyway.\n\nThis course is a conversation starter, not a conversation ender. It will help get you on the right path to being the best engineer and the best you, you can be.",
